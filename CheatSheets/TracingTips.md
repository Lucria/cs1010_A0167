## Some tips to tracing
1. Check for loops such as for loops and while loops 
2. See what's within them, another loop? Or conditional statements 
3. Trace pass by pass of each loop to be safe


## Tracing recursion 
1. Apply memoisation - identify a pattern in its returns 
2. Try sliding window technique - we ignore recursion of lower values and group em.
