<p>A simplified fare structure taken from <tt>www.taxisingapore.com/taxi-fare</tt> is given below.

<p><table >
<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><th>Meter Fare<th>Normal<th>Limousine<th>Chrysler
<tr><td>Flag-Down (inclusive of 1st km or less)<td align="center">$3.40<td align="center">$3.90<td align="center">$5.00

<tr><td>Every 350 metres thereafter or less after 10 km<td align="center">$0.22<td align="center">$0.22<td align="center">$0.33
</table>

<p><table >
<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><th>Midnight surcharge (applicable at time of boarding)<th>Additional
<tr><td>Midnight to 5.59am<td>50% of metered fare
</table>

<p><table >
<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><th>Peak hour surcharge (applicable at time of boarding)<th> Additional
<tr><td>Mon - Fri: 6.00am to 9.30am<td>25% of metered fare
<tr><td>Mon - Sun: 6.00pm to 23.59pm<td>25% of metered fare
</table>

<p>Using the fare structure above, your task is to write a program to compute the taxi fare given the follow input:

<dl>
<dt>Type of Taxi 
<dd><tt>1</tt> for Normal, <tt>2</tt> for Limousine, <tt>3</tt> for Chrysler
<dt>Distance travelled
<dd>An integer number (in m) &gt; <tt>0</tt>
<dt>Day of travel
<dd><tt>1</tt> for Monday, <tt>2</tt> for Tuesday, ..., <tt>7</tt> for Sunday
<dt>Hour of travel
<dd>An integer number between <tt>0</tt> (midnight) to <tt>23</tt> (11pm)
<dt>Minute of travel
<dd>An integer number between <tt>0</tt> to <tt>59</tt>
</dl>

<p>Note that the Day, Hour and Minute denotes the time of boarding.

<p>As an example, the input

<pre>
1 12500 6 18 33
</pre>

represents boarding a <tt>normal</tt> taxi on <tt>Saturday 6.33pm</tt> for a total travel distance of <tt>12500m</tt>.
The corresponding fare is computed as follows:

<p><table>
<tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td>Flag-Down (inclusive of 1st km or less)<td>$3.40<td>1m to 1000m
<tr><td>Every 400m thereafter or less up to 10km<td>$0.22 x 23 = $5.06<td>22 cents charged at 1001m, 1401m, ..., 9401m, 9801m
<tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td>Every 350 metres thereafter or less after 10 km<td>$0.22 x 8 = $1.76<td>22 cents charged at 10001m, 10351m, 10701m, ..., 12101m, 12451m
<tr><td>Metered fare<td>$10.22
<tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td>Peak-hour surcharge<td>25% of $10.22 = $2.55<td>(remaining $0.005 discounted)
<tr><td>Total fare<td>$12.77
</table>

<p>As a goodwill gesture, fares with denominations of 9 cents or less will be absorbed by your friendly taxi driver.  Hence the actual fare paid is $12.70.

<p>Take note of the following:
<ul>
<li>Assume that the distance travelled is greater than zero;
<li>To avoid imprecision in floating point representations, all fares are to be computed in terms of integer cents.
</ul>
</b>

<p>This task is divided into several levels.
Read through all the levels (from first to last, then from last to first) to see how the different levels are related.
<b>You may start from any level.</b>
